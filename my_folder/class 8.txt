1.
Candidate A is the safer candidate, as it is more likely they will perform at around 75. Candidate B has more upside, meaning they could turn out 
to be much better. However, it is also possible that they will perform much worse.

2.
Candidate B is better than candidate A. Since their productivity probability distribution are not overlapping, this means that there is no
prediction in which candidate A is better than candidate B.

3.
It seems like the probability forecast is quite inaccurate. Indeed, all the test data is greater than the mean. This means that the distribution
is biased and should have a positive mean.
